##Autogeneration
### Autogenerate can't detect
- Changes of table name. These will come out as an add/drop of two different tables, and should be hand-edited into a name change instead.

- Changes of column name. Like table name changes, these are detected as a column add/drop pair, which is not at all the same as a name change.
